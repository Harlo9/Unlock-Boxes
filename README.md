📝 Project Overview

This project is designed to optimize exploration and communication between two robots. The task involves two robots, two chests, and two keys, where each robot must locate its designated key and open its corresponding chest as quickly as possible.

🚀 Key Features

Efficient Exploration: Robots navigate the environment to locate their respective keys.
Collaboration & Communication: Robots exchange information to minimize redundant exploration.
Time Optimization: The system ensures tasks are completed in the shortest possible time.
🛠️ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pygame (for simulation and visualization)
numpy (for computations)
random (for key and chest placement)
logging (for debugging and performance tracking)
